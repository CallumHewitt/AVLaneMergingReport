Gipps first defines the acceleration profile of the vehicle. Whilst not exceeding the desired speed of the driver, the driver's acceleration should increase with the speed of the vehicle. The acceleration should then decrease to zero as the vehicle approaches the desired speed. This is expressed in the following inequality, obtained through measurements from an instrumented car. It is purely descriptive, which is considered acceptable as it doesn't affect the vehicle's following behaviour.

\begin{equation*}
v_n(t+\tau) \leqslant v_n(t) + 2.5a_n\tau\Biggl(\frac{1 - v_n(t)}{V_n}\Biggr)\Biggl(\frac{0.025 + v_n(t)}{V_n}\Biggr)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}

The next limits come on braking. If vehicle $n - 1$ begins braking, as hard as their $b_{n-1}$ limit states, at time $t$, it will come to rest at point $x_{n-1}^*$. This is given by

\begin{equation*}
x_{n-1}^* = x_{n-1}(t) - \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^2}{2b_{n-1}}
\end{equation*}

Vehicle $n$ travelling behind $n-1$ won't react until time $t + \tau$ so won't come to rest until

\begin{equation*}
x_n^* = x_n(t) + \frac{\tau\bigl[v_n(t) + v_n(t + \tau)\bigr]}{2} - \frac{v_n(t + \tau)^2}{2b_n}
\end{equation*}

From this we can deduce that the driver of vehicle $n$ must ensure that $x_{n-1}^* - s_{n-1}$. We also add a safety margin to allow for a possible delay of $\theta$. In other words we will get a delay of $\tau + \theta$. The braking limitation is therefore

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&x_{n-1}(t) - \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^2}{2b_{n-1}} - s_{n-1}\\
& \geqslant\\
& x_n(t) + \frac{\tau\bigl[v_n(t) + v_n(t + \tau)\bigr]}{2} + v_n(t + \tau)\theta - \frac{v_n(t + \tau)^2}{2b_n}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

In real life it is possible for the driver of $n$ to estimate all values in the above equation except for $b_{n-1}$. Therefore $b_{n-1}$ should be replaced by an estimate $\hat{b}$ giving

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&\frac{-v_n(t + \tau)^2}{2b_n} + v_n(t + \tau)(\frac{\tau}{2} + \theta) - \bigl[x_{n-1}(t) - s_{n-1} - x_n(t)\bigr] + \frac{v_n(t)\tau}{2} + \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^2}{2\hat{b}} \\
&\leqslant 0 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

If $\theta$ is equal to $\frac{\theta}{2}$ and $\hat{b}$ wasn't underestimated then a vehicle can remain travelling at safe speeds and distances forever. Therefore we can write

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&\frac{-v_n(t + \tau)^2}{2b_n} + v_n(t + \tau)\tau - \bigl[x_{n-1}(t) - s_{n-1} - x_n(t)\bigr] + \frac{v_n(t)\tau}{2} + \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^2}{2\hat{b}} \\
&\leqslant 0 \\
&\therefore \\
&v_n(t + \tau) \leqslant \\
&b_n\tau + \sqrt{\Biggl(b_n^2\tau^2 - b_n\biggl(2\Bigl[x_{n-1}(t) - s_{n-1} - x_n(t)\Bigr] - v_n(t)\tau - \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^2}{b}\biggr)\Biggr)}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
