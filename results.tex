Lilian Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It will be interesting to have a graph with |C| on the x-axis and throughput on y-axis. Similarly, a 3D graph where  |Ctl| on the x-axis, |Cml| on the y-axis, and throughput on z-axis.
\end{enumerate}

Callum Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As a "things I'd do differently" or "changes to make" it would be cool to move to a Spring implementation. It might make it easier to add different simulator types.
